# NgGiphyApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI]
I have spent 3 days working on this project. If I had more time, I would have added a few animations and a loader.

## Development server

Run `npm install` to install dependencies, then run `npm start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
